# LSTM & CNN Sinus
Prediction of Sinus 
It is well known that artificial neural networks are good at modeling any function. I wonder whether they can go one step further, and learn the generalized model of a function. For simplicity letâ€™s try to learn a sine function with just one parameter A, which controls the frequency:
y = sin(A*x)
For us humans, once we understand the sine function, we know how it behaves under any parameter A. If we are presented with a partial sine wave, we can figure out what A should be, and we can extrapolate the wave out to infinity.

We used Conv1D layers, since our data is one dimensional.
`model.add(Dense(1))`
LSTM network retains memory of the data it has seen in the past
`model.add(LSTM(length, input_shape=(length, 1)))`


and it's a train result :

IN CONCLUSION, THE PREDICTION IS :
